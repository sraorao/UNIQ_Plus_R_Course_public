# UNIQ_PLUS
In this 3 day R course, participants will learn how to reproducibly analyse and plot data and interpret results. It will be a practical course using general datasets aimed at beginners with no prior programming experience. Topics covered include reading and writing data, cleaning and dealing with missing data, exploratory data analysis, plotting various kinds of graphs, automating tasks using loops, and documentation. 

We will use a collaborative notebook to write notes and ask questions.

# UNIQ_PLUS
In this 3 day R course, participants will learn how to reproducibly analyse and plot data and interpret results. It will be a practical course using general datasets aimed at beginners with no prior programming experience. Topics covered include reading and writing data, cleaning and dealing with missing data, exploratory data analysis, plotting various kinds of graphs, automating tasks using loops, and documentation. We will use a collaborative notebook to write notes and ask questions. https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/uniqplus_test

Day 1
- Introductions
- Software Installation
- Motivation - NYC squirrel dataset - research questions and hypotheses, order by complexity
- Reading and summarising dataframes (some simple dataset e.g. Iris or use NYC Squirrel)
- Exploratory data analysis (e.g. Iris or NYC Squirrel)
- Research question 1 exercise
- Tidyverse introduction
- Installing packages **not sure if it would be better to introduce how to install packages, libraries and get data from them at the very beggining**
- Research question 2 exercise
- data structures (atomic vectors, data frames, lists, matrices)
- RQ 3, 4, 5... (afternoon)

Day 2
- Introduce new dataset
- Motovation - brainstorm for new research questions that require plotting? recreate a given plot from a publication or newspaper?
- **Would be maybe good to let them do some data exploration (so they practice a bit what they have done the day befor) and then do small chat on what they have noticed, explored etc.**
- Plotting with base R
- Exercise
- Plotting with ggplot2
- Exercise
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Exercise

Day 3
- Merging dataframes
- Statistical tests
- Motivation - brainstorm for RQs
- Exercise
- Show a simple function; Writing your own functions
- Exercise using own function
- Reproducible data analysis (commenting, Rmarkdown)
- Capstone project (1 - 2 hours?) working in groups - scientific data and fun data
- Work through solutions
- Additional resources
- Presentation of results in groups

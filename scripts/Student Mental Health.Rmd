## Student Mental Health database



```{r import}
data= read.csv("Student Mental health.csv")
View(data)
```

## Data Exploration

```{r data}
dim(data) # 101 observations, 11 variables

summary(data) 

# From here it looks like having the course/current year of Study, Gender and others as factor instead of character could be useful. Let us change at least the "Your.current.year.of.study" variable.

# Careful! There are "year 1" and "Year 1" which will look different when transformed to factor.
data$Your.current.year.of.Study= toupper(data$Your.current.year.of.Study)
data$Your.current.year.of.Study= as.factor(data$Your.current.year.of.Study)
summary(data$Your.current.year.of.Study)


```

```{r}
table(is.na(data))

data[table(is.na(data)),] # is that an extra row? Where is it?
```

## QUESTIONS


```{r}
# How many students declared to be "depressed"?

sum(data$Do.you.have.Depression. == "Yes")

# How many of the depressed students had also anxiety?

sum(data$Do.you.have.Depression. == "Yes" & data$Do.you.have.Anxiety.== "Yes")

# How many of these looked for help?

sum(data$Do.you.have.Depression. == "Yes" & data$Do.you.have.Anxiety.== "Yes" & data$Did.you.seek.any.specialist.for.a.treatment.== "Yes")

# Are these students males or females?

data$Choose.your.gender[data$Do.you.have.Depression. == "Yes" & data$Do.you.have.Anxiety.== "Yes" & data$Did.you.seek.any.specialist.for.a.treatment.== "Yes"]
```

```{r}
# What is the course with more depressed students?
data$What.is.your.course.[max(data$Do.you.have.Depression.== "Yes")]

```

```{r}
# Plot the marital status of the dataset. Does marital status have any effect on depression?
plot(data$Marital.status) # Does not work! Why?

class(data$Marital.status)
data$Marital.status= as.factor(data$Marital.status)

plot(data$Marital.status)

data$Do.you.have.Depression.= as.factor(data$Do.you.have.Depression.)
plot(data$Marital.status~data$Do.you.have.Depression.)
plot(data$Do.you.have.Depression.~data$Marital.status)

sum(data$Marital.status == "Yes" & data$Do.you.have.Depression.=="Yes") # 16 students
sum(data$Marital.status == "Yes" & data$Do.you.have.Depression.=="No") # There are no married students that have No depression. That means all the no depressed students are not married. Let us check that:

data2= data[data$Do.you.have.Depression. == "No",]
View (data2) # Looks like all the No depressed students are Not Married!

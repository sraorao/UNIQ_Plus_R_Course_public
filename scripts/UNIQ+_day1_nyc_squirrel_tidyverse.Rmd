## Reading data from files
The `read` family functions are useful for reading text-based data formats like csv (comma-separated value), tsv (tab-separated value) and txt.

```{r}
# reading data from file
squirrel <- read.csv("../datasets/nyc_squirrel_uniq_plus.csv")

```




## Subsetting a data.frame

```{r}
squirrel %>%
  head()

squirrel %>%
  select(Unique.Squirrel.ID)

```


## Filtering



```{r}
squirrel %>%
  filter(Age == "Adult")
```

## Summarising a data.frame



```{r}
squirrel %>%
  group_by(Age) %>%
  summarise(mean(Weight))

```
